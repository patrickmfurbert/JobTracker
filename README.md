# JobTracker
Webapp to assist tracking of internship/job hunting efforts

# Development Setup Instructions
For initial setup:
1) Clone Repo
2) From the command line cd into back_end and type "npm install"
3) Start backend with "nodejs app.js"
4) From the command line cd into front_end and type "npm install"
5) Start frontend with "npm start"

# Project Requirements
The functionality of the web app would include:  
--Account creation (user auth)  
--Users can create jobs/internships  
--Users can also create 'skills' which can relate to specific jobs/internships: Allows them to track which jobs require which skills, see how frequently certain skills are noted within applications, and track how comfortable they are with those skills/if they need to work on those skills more (ex: 'Docker is noted in 60% of your applications').  
--Users can create 'contacts': keep track of networking, contact information for individuals they've networked with who may be related to specific jobs/companies they're applying to.    

Stretch Goals:  
--Incorporate Glassdoor's API and/or reddit's API, to display data related to certain jobs. Use these to research certain internship application processes
